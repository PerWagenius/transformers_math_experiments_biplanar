# PatternBoost: Constructions in Mathematics with a Little Help from AI

This repository contains the code for **PatternBoost**, an algorithm that alternates between local search and transformer-based global pattern learning to find new constructions in mathematics, particularly in extremal combinatorics. 

## Overview
PatternBoost consists of two iterative phases:
1. **Local phase**: A classical search algorithm optimizes mathematical constructions.
2. **Global phase**: A transformer neural network is trained on the best constructions from the local phase, generating new seeds for the next iteration.

The projectâ€™s goal is to provide mathematicians with an accessible tool that balances simplicity and performance without requiring deep machine learning expertise.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Julia 1.6+

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/zawagner22/transformers_math_experiments.git
```
2. Navigate to the directory and install dependencies for python and julia

## Usage
1. Pick a problem from 'search_fc.jl'. You can create new problems based on the examples provided.
2. Configure your parameters in 'fc_loop.py'.
3. Run PatternBoost:
```
python fc_loop.py
```
