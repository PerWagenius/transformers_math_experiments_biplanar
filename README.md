Code accompanying the paper "PatternBoost: Constructions in Mathematics with a Little Help from AI"

<b>Step 1:</b> Pick a problem at the start of 'search_fc.jl'. If you would like to run a problem that's not one of the three examples provided, it is simple to create a new julia file for it -- just follow the three examples provided.

<b>Step 2:</b> Choose the parameters you would like to run at the start of fc_loop.py

<b>Step 3:</b> Run fc_loop.py to start PatternBoost!
```
python fc_loop.py
```
